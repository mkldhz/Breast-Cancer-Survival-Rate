# Breast Cancer Survival Rate
The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reihanenamdari/breast-cancer) can be described as set of patient's clinical features. This dataset of breast cancer patients was obtained from SEER Program of the NCI, which provides information on population-based cancer statistics. The dataset involved female patients with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer. Patients with unknown tumour size, examined regional LNs, positive regional LNs, and patients whose survival months were less than 1 month were excluded; thus, 4024 patients were ultimately included. This dataset was uploaded to U-BRITE for [AI against CANCER DATA SCIENCE HACKATHON](https://cancer.ubrite.org/hackathon-2021/).

# Goal
The goal was to create a (classifier) model that is able to take the data of the patient and output whether the model thinks the patient will survive or not and output how confident it is in such a prediction.
